Project Name: Contacts Manager Pro

Description:
Contacts Manager Pro is an end-to-end full-stack application that enables users to manage their contacts seamlessly. This application mimics the Apple's MacBook Pro's Contacts App with all likewise features with minor twists and different features. 

In this application, I included the 'contacts upload' feature which includes a VCF file parser that I developed with Python and Django to extract contacts and store in my MySQL database. Additionally, the remaining contacts management features utilize Ruby and Ruby on Rails to perform the CRUD functions.

Last, but not least, the front-end is purely built with JavaScript and Next.js with Tailwind CSS for a sleek and modern UI design. I also utilize axios to pull data from my back-end and Redux.js for global state management to efficiently render data across the application.
